# Community Art Gallery

The Discord Community Gallery is a 3D web art exhibition. My brother, Koof, made the environment art for this project.
The project consists out of a frontend, server, and Discord bot. It was made to encourage members of our Discord server to share their art. Every monday, it picks five art submissions based on engagement (reactions, replies, pins) and displays them in the gallery.
It additionally picks a single audio submission from that week and makes it playable on the gramophone.
The front end is vanilla JS. It uses three.js for model loading and 3D rendering, and the Web Audio API for audio. Both the server and the bot are written in C# .NET 7
